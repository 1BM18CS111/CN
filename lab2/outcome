in this topology when we ping from pc 1 to pc 2 we get reply from pc2 and when we
ping ip address in command prompt we get
32 bytes of data and time = 1ms and TTl= 127
then if we see the ping statistics for ip add:
then there is 4 packets and in this we received 3 packets and one lost with apx 
round trip of minimum 0ms and maximum 1ms means here loss is 25%
but again when we ping ip add 
in ping stats we receive all 4 packets and there is 0% loss
