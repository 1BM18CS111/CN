while ping ip address in command prompt we get
32 bytes of data and time = 1ms and TTl= 127
ping statistics for ip add:
where packets=4 and in this we received 3 packets and one lost with apx 
round trip of minimum 0ms and maximum 1ms means here loss is 25%
but again when we ping ip add 
in ping stats we receive all 4 packets and there is 0% loss
